# Sentiment Aanalysis on Movie Reviews

## Project Overview
This project is designed to analyze sentiment from movie reviews using a BERT-based model. The pipeline includes data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment, orchestrated with Apache Airflow. The project utilizes DVC for data versioning and model tracking, MLflow for experiment tracking, and FastAPI for serving the model through an API.

## Project Requirements

- We used Python 3.9.16, but latest version should also work but might be incompatible with some libraries like airflow etc.
- Virtualenv or Conda for environment management 
- DVC for data version control
- MLflow for experiment tracking
- Apache Airflow for orchestrating workflows
- FastAPI for serving the model through an API
- We should AWS as our preferred cloud platform and MongoDB for storing data.
